Tool to design primers for gene fusions based on genomic breakpoints.

Take a pair of genomic coordinates describing both breakpoints of a gene fusion event, and return some primers to
generate an amplicon across the fusion junction.

Start with genomic fusion only, later add transcripts.

Functional overview.
1) from the command line, take coordinates as input, in format chr1:23456389. 1st coordinate should be the 5' gene,
2nd coordinate should be the 3' gene.
2) query genome browser/database with the coordinates
3) identify the gene(s) in which the breaks are located
4) determine strand for each gene
5) get 500bp of sequence up/downstream of each breakpoint
6) supply sequences to primer design tool (eg primer3)
7) return list of potential primer pairs and design details

Required inputs:
1) pair of genomic coordinates
2)
